# Green-Taxi-Data-Visualization
PowerBI visualization on US Green Taxi Data to analyse the driver earnings and derive insights on the company's trip patterns. This README provides an overview of the PowerBI dashboard and the story presented in it.

## Dataset
The data is collected by the New York City Taxi and Limousine commission about "Green" Taxis. I have performed visual analysis on one month data (December 2018).

Data is available at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page


## Visual Analysis
I have performed the analysis on two different themes:
- Driver Earnings
- Trip Information
