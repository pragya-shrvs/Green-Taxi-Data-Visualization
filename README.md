# Green-Taxi-Data-Visualization
Power bi visualization on US Green Taxi Data to analyse the driver earnings and understand the trip patterns.

## Dataset
The data is collected by the New York City Taxi and Limousine commission about "Green" Taxis. I have performed visual analysis on one month data (December 2018).

Data is available at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page


## Visual Analysis
I have drawn the analysis on two different themes:
- Driver Earnings
- Trip Information
